  Of course it&rsquo;s a good idea to visit Bevis Marks  synagogue.  It&rsquo;s the opposite direction  from Sandys Row (synagogue) and Dirty Dicks (pub), going south on  Bishopsgate.   It&rsquo;s beautiful and  interesting.  There is little need to  talk about it here.  They have their own  website which probably cost them a fortune.   It&rsquo;s fabulous for understanding their own self-image.    It could be the one of the more pretentious  websites of all time, sonorous music and all that. The link to the website is  here: <a href="http://www.bevismarks.org.uk/">http://www.bevismarks.org.uk/</a> }<br>

  <em>Image:  This postcard recalls the service held to celebrate the one-hundreth birthday  of Sir Moses Montefiore at Bevis Marks in 1884.  </em><em>It also depicts Hermann Adler</em></p>
<p align="center">Related to the above postcard:  here&rsquo;s a fabulous project at UCL on the  &lsquo;Montefiore testimonials&rsquo; directed by the dashing Dr Francois Guesnet. <br>

  Here&rsquo;s a postcard of the Chief Rabbi at the  time, pictured in the postcard (of Bevis Marks synagogue, 1894), Hermann Adler  (1839-1911).  It was taken and produced  by one of the many Jewish photographers active in the London at the time, H.S.  Mendelssohn.  In fact, Jews may have  constituted the majority of London photographers almost from the inception of  the field in the mid-nineteenth century to the 1950s and 60s.<br>

There is a street (possibly) named after him off  the Whitechapel High Street, just west of the Whitechapel Foundry. </p>

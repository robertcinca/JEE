<p align="center"><br>
  Call me crass. Let&rsquo;s go from the soup kitchen  for the poor—now, of course, turned into expensive flats--to one of the best  restaurants in the East End:  St Johns in  Spitalfields.   It&rsquo;s, well, not quite  kosher, as you may surmise from its piggy logo.   One of my favorite proper sit-down restaurants in London, it&rsquo;s famous  for making fabulous dishes out of parts of beasts you didn&rsquo;t even know existed  or may have found disgusting.</p>

  My favorite foodie writer, Jay Rayner, loves  this place (St. Johns, Spitalfields).  I  even saw him eating here, really enjoying himself. <br>

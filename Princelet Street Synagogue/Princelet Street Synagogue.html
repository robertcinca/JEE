<h1 align="center"><strong>Princelet Street Synagogue</strong><strong> </strong></h1>
<p align="center"><br>
  Also off Brick Lane is Princelet Street, which  is now quite well known for the sort-of rediscovered synagogue at number  19.   In my opinion the book by Ian  Sinclair and Rachael Lichtenstein, <em>Rodinsky&rsquo;s Room</em>, is overrated, but maybe  you&rsquo;ll find it interesting.   I&rsquo;m not  sure of the status of the &lsquo;Museum of Immigration&rsquo; in the building. <br>

<p>Around the corner from Princelet Street, on  Wilkes Street, is another sign from a formerly Jewish business.     H. Suskin (Textiles) Ltd<br>

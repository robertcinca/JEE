<h1 align="center"><strong>Soup Kitchen for the Jewish Poor</strong></h1>
<p align="center"><br>
  <br>
  I strongly recommend visiting what used to be a soup kitchen for the Jewish  poor, established by Jewish philanthropists—supposedly including Israel  Zangwill.  It&rsquo;s a little tricky to find  but worth the effort.  Go south from  Sandys Row synagogue down Artillery Passage.   Before it sort-of turns into White&rsquo;s Row, make a right turn onto Bell  Lane and left to Brune Street.  You  probably won&rsquo;t miss it but it&rsquo;s on the north side of the Street.<br>

  In the excellent guide to the Jewish East End  prepared by my friend and colleague Clive Bettington, we learn that the  architect of this Jewish soup kitchen was Lewis Solomon, and it was erected in  1902. <br>

<p>Most of the Jews who lived in Whitechapel, and  the East End in general, until about the 1950s, were poor, many even destitute.  But the immigrants who arrived from the 1870s  to 1905 usually considered themselves better off than they had been, when they  lived in Russia&rsquo;s Pale of Settlement, because they were able to work for a much  longer &lsquo;season&rsquo; than was possible in their former homes.  That is, in the kind of garment industries in  which they worked, like boot-making and cap-making, the &lsquo;season&rsquo; was only a  fraction of the year. There was, indeed, substantial help from the more established  English Jews.  Christian missionary  societies fed the poor and offered comfort to the distressed.  The missionaries, however, operated with the  intention that they would bring about the conversion (to Christianity) of those  they helped.  <br>

<h1 align="center"><strong>Dirty Dicks Pub</strong></h1>
<p align="center"><br>
  Pass through Liverpool Street Station, to  Bishopsgate.  Cross the street.  You&rsquo;ll see one of my favorite pub signs.  202 Bishopsgate, EC2M 4NR.  In its long history it was once called &ldquo;The  Old Jerusalem.&rdquo;  <br>

  Dirty Dicks.   Really makes you want to eat there, doesn&rsquo;t it?  (Thank you, historian David Dennis, for that  joke.  David is Professor of History at  Loyola University Chicago.  He is the  author of <em>Beethoven and German Politics</em> [1996] and <em>Inhumanities:  Nazi Interpretations of Western Culture</em> [2012].)  <br>

  I find the cartoon on the sign striking.  It&rsquo;s a classic antisemitic image, but the  name is not Jewish.  I don&rsquo;t object to  this at all:  a stock East End and  cockney countenance.  <br>
  I hope they don&rsquo;t ever get rid of these signs, no matter how offensive they may  be (to those with no sense of humor or history.)<br>

  Dirty Dicks is a wonderfully complex place:  three different settings within the building. <br>
  The lowest level is the oldest bar, which has a  museum-like exhibition of some the older fittings and kitsch. <br>
  Upstairs, and throughout the pub you can find  historical caricatures—including a number of them about Jews.  They&rsquo;re worth a close look. <br>
  Although it may look like any London pub, the  food is quite good—nothing unusual but &lsquo;home made&rsquo;. </p>

<h1 align="center"><strong>The Cut Corner of Jewish Business Establishments</strong></h1>
<p align="center"><br>
  Now you can see some evidence of what connects  Jewish existence in their former lives, in this case, mainly (what is now)  Lithuania, with what was to become Anglo-Jewry.   In the words of my dear friend Chaim Bargman (from Kovno/Kaunas):  &ldquo;the cut corner.&rdquo;  We&rsquo;re on the corner of Chance and Redchurch  Streets.  There are a number of good  cafes, galleries, and shops on Redchurch Street.  <br>

  One might say:   what&rsquo;s Jewish about this?   Probably something.  Most likely  it&rsquo;s more &ldquo;Jewish&rdquo; than the so-called &ldquo;Jewish Star.&rdquo;   In Lithuania and elsewhere, Jews came up  with notion of having &lsquo;cut-corners&rsquo; on their businesses that faced two streets.  That way they might get more foot traffic, and they would be able to say that  they were located on both streets. I&rsquo;m sure others besides Jews did this, but  it seems to be a strong and consistent tendency among Jews from Lithuania.  A significant number of immigrants to the  East End, beginning in the 1870s, were indeed &lsquo;Litvaks.&rsquo;   On this corner all four businesses had  &lsquo;cut-corners.&rsquo;  (Chance and Redchurch  Streets.)<br>

  Not easy to find, but worth it:  the alley next to the Whitechapel Gallery  (77-82 Whitechapel High Street, London E1).   In a very anarchistic manner, one follows the KFC sign.  I'll bet they don't even know how fitting  that is. <br>

  Religion/Politics:  Anarchism, old-style </p>
<ul>
  <li>Freedom Press Bookshop,  84b Whitechapel High Street, E1. </li>
  <li>This wall, on the side  of the Freedom Press Bookshop, consists of not especially attractive (or even  reasonable likenesses) of a number of leading anarchists. </li>
  <li>Anarchism was a major  force in the East End from the late nineteenth century into the interwar  period. </li>
  <li>As practised by most of  its followers in the East End, anarchism rested on the principles of &lsquo;no  coercion&rsquo; and &lsquo;no exploitation&rsquo;.  There  is little or no continuity between those who call themselves anarchists now and  those depicted here.  </li>
  <li>Modern anarchists  wouldn&rsquo;t know Emma Goldman if she fell on them. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>On this subject see the great  Bill Fishman (z''l) for several books on Jewish radicals of the East End.  See also the recent book by David Rosenberg, <em><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/10/rebel-footprints-guide-to-uncovering-londons-radical-history-david-rosenberg-review">Rebel Footprints:  A Guide to Uncovering London's Radical  History</a></em></li>

<p><strong>Emma Goldman</strong><br>
  Here are some better pictures of Emma Goldman  (1869-1940).  She never lived in London  but spent a fair amount of time here.   She&rsquo;s known as pioneering feminist as well as an anarchist.  Born in Kovno, part of the Russian Empire  (now Kaunas), she moved to Rochester, New York, and New York City before being  exiled from the United States.  She was  an early critic of the increasingly authoritarian character of Bolshevik rule. <br>

  She is reputed to have said:  &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t dance I don&rsquo;t want your revolution.&rdquo;  Although it&rsquo;s unlikely she ever said that,  precisely, it does fit her world-view. <br>

<p><strong>Alexander  Berkman</strong><strong> </strong><br>
  Also on the wall, in the top left corner, is  Alexander Berkman (1870-1936) —who may have been one of my relatives.  Berkman, like Goldman, was from Kovno and  lived in upstate New York.  Here he is  pictured next to Ba Jin (1904-2005), the Chinese writer and anarchist.  <br>

<p><strong>Ba Jin</strong><br>
Ba Jin, also known as Li Fei-Kan and Li Yaotang,  was an ardent admirer of Emma Goldman.  I  wish to thank Linda, Yining, and Xaujon for noticing the presence and  importance of Ba Jin.  For a famous  letter of Ba Jin to Emma Goldman, see <a href="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Goldman/Features/BaJin_letter2.html">here.</a></p>

<h1 align="center"><strong>Liverpool Street Station</strong></h1>
<p align="center"><br>
  Probably the best place to begin a tour of the  Jewish East End is Liverpool Street Station.   Here you have something new-ish, which is a reminder of a very important  event.  At the southwest corner of the  station is &lsquo;Hope Square,&rsquo; featuring this sculpture where you can relax and plan  your excursion.  <br>

  Well-put, I&rsquo;d say (plaque at Hope Square). <br>

  In the wake of the pogroms of the 9th  and 10th November 1938 in Nazi Germany, what is now termed the <em>Reichskristallnacht</em>,  British citizens launched an extraordinary effort:  the Kindertransport.  Thousands of unaccompanied Jewish children  were brought into Britain.  Around 2,500  of them were Protestant and Catholic, but classified as &ldquo;Jewish&rdquo; under the  absurd Nazi race laws.   Liverpool Street  Station, is, indeed,<br>
  an appropriate place for such a monument.</p>
<p>The best book on Kristallnacht is by Alan  Steinweis:<br>

  Some people find the Kindertransport sculpture  tacky, or kitschy.  I think its good and  a really fitting memorial--and in the right place.<br>
Liverpool Street Station remains a major hub for transport, and there are many  sites of Jewish interest within a few minute stroll.</p>

  The points of embarkation, where the children of  the Kindertransport left, are important to recall. Some might object to the  litter on the sculpture.  It gets cleaned  up. And it&rsquo;s not a terrible thing.   Littering, after all, is an English trait.  &lsquo;Hope Square&rsquo; is not pristine. <br>

  On the lower level of Liverpool Street Station,  conveniently located at the &ldquo;Meeting Point,&rdquo; is another small sculpture.  This, too, recalls the Kindertransport as  well as additional efforts to bring Jewish children to Britain in the face of  the Nazi menace—the most important of which was the mission of Nicholas  Winton.  Make sure to see both versions. <br>

  On the subject of unaccompanied children  welcomed to Britain:  <br>
  Nicholas Winton himself was responsible for the rescue of over 650 children  from Nazi occupied Czech lands.  <br>
  This is a good synopsis of his importance:<br>

  It&rsquo;s not easy to see here but there&rsquo;s a subtle  &lsquo;Star of David&rsquo; image in the clock face of Liverpool Street Station tower.  It&rsquo;s probably a meaningless, generic symbol  and I don&rsquo;t know when it appeared there.   But some might read more into it.   There are a few others like it, mainly on churches, in the East End. <br>

<p>Star of David </p>
<ul>
  <li>The &lsquo;star&rsquo; or &lsquo;shield&rsquo; of  David, supposedly a symbol from the time of the biblical King David, is now  mainly regarded as a Jewish symbol. </li>
  <li>As you can see on the Liverpool  Street Station clock tower, and at least two other places in the East End, it  was used as a generic symbol, as well, on religious as well as private and  municipal buildings.  It also can be  found in continental Europe. </li>
  <li>The foundational historian of  Jewish mysticism, Gershom Scholem, wrote about the largely  non-Jewishly-specific history of the symbol. </li>
  <li>Although it was used by  numerous Jewish philanthropic and proto-nationalist organizations prior to  1897, after the Zionist Congress in Basel (now known as the First Zionist  Congress), it mainly came to be associated with the Zionist Movement, as well  as a generic Jewish representation. </li>
  <li>More on this can be found in  Michael Berkowitz, <em>Zionist Culture and West European Jewry before the First  World War</em> (Cambridge University Press, 1993, and University of North  Carolina Press, 1996). </li>
</ul>
<p>The Gherkin </p>
<ul>
  <li>I don&rsquo;t know if Jews have  anything to do with the Gherkin.  It&rsquo;s a  fabulous building which is now a major symbol of both London and the East End </li>
  <li>From Hope Square you have a  great view of it </li>
  <li>The Gherkin is a reminder that  you should ask for &ldquo;gherkins&rdquo; on your hot salt beef sandwich—preferably from  Beigel Bake.  Even if you think you don&rsquo;t  care for pickles—give it a try.  The  combination is great. </li>

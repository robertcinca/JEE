<h1 align="center"><strong>Jewish and Jewish-friendly bookshops</strong></h1>
<p align="center"><br>
  (in America one would say &ldquo;bookstores&rdquo;) <br>
  (not &lsquo;religious&rsquo; stuff, per se)</p>
<h2><strong>Joseph&rsquo;s  Bookstore</strong></h2>
<p><br>
  <a href="http://www.josephsbookstore.com/">http://www.josephsbookstore.com</a><br>
  Joseph&rsquo;s bookshop in Temple Fortune.  This is an absolutely excellent shop.  I don't think it has a NYC equal.  <br>
  Visiting there is a good excuse to try Hot Salt  Beef Bar No. 2. <br>
  As long as you&rsquo;re in the area, also see John  Trotter in the Sternberg Centre, Finchley Central:  Manor House Books.  This is not to be confused with &quot;Manor  House&quot; in N4.</p>

  While you&rsquo;re there, if this is your thing, you  can see the Margaret Thatcher plaque from the inauguration of the site.  </p>
<h2><strong>Charing  Cross Road Bookstores</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong><br>
  Some other bookstores in Charing Cross Road and  further out also pay special attention to things Jewish. <br>
  Sadly, it no longer exists but you can visit the  site of Marks&rsquo;s bookshop, 84 Charing Cross Road, inspiration for the shmaltzy  book and movie.  <br>
  The son of the owner was Leo Marks, a  fascinating writer himself.  He wrote the  screenplay of the controversial film <em>Peeping  Tom</em> (1960), and we can do a whole tour of sites from that film. </p>
<h2><strong>Owl  Bookshop</strong></h2>
<p><br>
  For no special reason, the Owl Bookshop in  Kentish Town has sponsored outstanding writers and events of Jewish  interest.  Their bash for Charlotte  Mendelsohn was tremendous.  </p>
<h2><br>
  <strong>Pages  of Hackney</strong></h2>
<p><br>
  This is now my local.  Small but excellent.<br>

<h1 align="center"><strong>Entrance Arch, Wentworth Street</strong></h1>
<p align="center"><br>
  As one walks down Brick Lane:  off Wentworth Street, to the right:  All that remains is the entrance arch!  The buildings, erected by a group of (mainly  Jewish) philanthropists and businessmen, don&rsquo;t exist but many others do from  similar projects.  The objective of such  endeavors was to provide better housing for workers.  It&rsquo;s &ldquo;4%&rdquo; because that&rsquo;s what was promised to  the investors, in addition to the charitable subscriptions.  My friend Clive refers to this as &ldquo;The  Rothschild Archway.&rdquo;<br>

<p>The best guide to the Jewish East End, besides  this one, of course, is that prepared by Clive Bettington for Tower  Hamlets.  Get a hold of their  walking-tour map and guide. </p>

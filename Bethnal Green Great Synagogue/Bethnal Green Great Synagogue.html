<p align="center"><strong>Bethnal Green Great Synagogue</strong><br>
  From the direction of Liverpool Street Station  and Spitalfields market, after passing through the tunnel,with Shoreditch  overground station on your left, you see in front of you a former synagogue—now  flats and businesses.  This was the  Bethnal Green Great Synagogue.</p>

  Now we&rsquo;re at Shoreditch Boxpark (next to  Shoreditch High Street Overground Station.)   The next photos of the former Bethnal Green Great Synagogue are taken  from the upper deck.  I generally don&rsquo;t  like shopping malls but this seems to be an intelligently updated version of  the old market-stall idea.<br>

  You can see that this was a rather large  synagogue, at some point (Bethnal Green Great Synagogue).  At least the Jewish star remains.  Again, it seems to be pricey flats.  Thank you, Sharman Kadish, for your help  identifying it.  (There is no  plaque.)  <br>
  Sharman is author of a terrific book about the history of synagogues in Britain.  There&rsquo;s nothing like it for America or any  other country.   With Clive Bettington,  she&rsquo;s been one of the most courageous and constructive people fighting to  preserve the architectural heritage of the Jewish East End.  For the most part, the mainstream United  Synagogue (official religious organization) has been a poor custodian (to say  the least) of Anglo-Jewish history.<br>

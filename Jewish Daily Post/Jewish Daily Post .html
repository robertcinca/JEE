<h1 align="center"><strong>Jewish Daily Post</strong></h1>
<p align="center"><br>
  Back at Whitechapel High Street, a little to the  left above the shop &lsquo;Albert&rsquo;s&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll see a beautiful emblem  with a Star of David.  That was to mark the offices of the <em>Jewish  Daily Post </em>(some say &lsquo;News&rsquo;), one of many Jewish newspapers (back in the  days when people read newspapers).  It  was made by Arthur Szyk (1894-1951), an interesting artist.  He didn&rsquo;t like the anarchists.  He himself was a rather right-wing  Zionist.  But he was a pretty good artist  and excellent craftsman.   The biography  by Joseph Ansell, <em>Arthur Szyk:   Artist, Jew, Pole</em> (2004) is good but perhaps a bit generous. </p>

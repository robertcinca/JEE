  <em>Nisht fur di yidn</em> (not quite for the Jews): King&rsquo;s College London</p>

<p>In the Lenny Bruce view of &quot;Jewish&quot;  versus &quot;Goyish&quot;: <u>UCL</u> is Jewish, King's is Goyish.</p>
<p>King&rsquo;s College London, now an outstanding and  (mostly) liberal institution, has a rather unsavory history with regard to  Jews.  Maybe not as bad as Oxbridge, but  not exactly flattering.  KCL owes its  very existence to members of the London&rsquo;s conservative, Anglican establishment  being appalled by the idea that a university in London would actually welcome  Jews and other motley types. <br>
  But KCL did become home to some important Jewish  scholars, like Rosalind Franklin and H. G. Adler. </p>

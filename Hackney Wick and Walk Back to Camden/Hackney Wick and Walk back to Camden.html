<h1 align="center"><strong>Hackney Wick and Walk Back to Camden</strong></h1>
<p align="center"><br>
  Now for something completely different:  you can start out from near Zangwill&rsquo;s home  across from Victoria Park and work backwards!   For those with time and energy:   walk a few miles down the Regent Canal to Camden Town.  Do take advantage of the location in order to  stroll along London&rsquo;s wonderful (and often overlooked) canals.  You can exit (or enter) right at Old Ford  Road.  You can also head north from  Bethnal Green Station to see the fabulous town hall converted into a hotel and  the hipster, art-gallery quarter.<br>

  What a coincidence!  (On the canal.)  This is one of the places I was going to tell  you to visit next:  Hackney Wick.  It&rsquo;s the home of <u>Fish Island</u>, London  (and the world&rsquo;s) original and best manufacturer of smoked salmon, <u>Forman&rsquo;s</u>.  (&ldquo;Lox&rdquo; in the US and elsewhere.) <a href="http://www.formansfishisland.com/">http://www.formansfishisland.com/</a> <br>

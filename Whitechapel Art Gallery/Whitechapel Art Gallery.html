<h1 align="center"><strong>Whitechapel Art Gallery</strong></h1>
<p align="center"><br>
  Don&rsquo;t get confused.  Brick Lane changes its name when you approach  Whitechapel High Street.  Keep going onto  Osborn Street.  Then turn right and  you&rsquo;ll see the fabulous Whitechapel Art Gallery.  <br>
  <a href="http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/">http://www.whitechapelgallery.org</a><br>
  I think it&rsquo;s one of the most beautiful building  reconstructions in all of London.  It&rsquo;s  almost more like something you&rsquo;d see in Budapest or Vienna.  Look at it from across the street.<br>

  See the blue plaque for Isaac Rosenberg (between  the entrance to the Aldgate East Tube station and the Whitechapel  Gallery)--especially significant in recalling the First World War. Rosenberg  was an exceptionally talented poet and painter. <br>
  Whitechapel Art Gallery:  the gem of the East End. Also be sure to  visit the bookshop, (Walther) Koenig&rsquo;s.   The original is on Charing Cross Road.    Koenig took over what had been Zwemmer&rsquo;s.  <a href="http://www.buchhandlung-walther-koenig.de/koenig2/index.php?mode=lang&lang=en">http://www.buchhandlung-walther-koenig.de/koenig2/index.php?mode=lang&amp;lang=en</a> (Yes, it&rsquo;s in German). <br>

<p><strong>Whitechapel Gallery Cafe</strong><br>
  As long as we&rsquo;re talking about the Whitechapel  Gallery, let&rsquo;s visit a corner that isn&rsquo;t much talked about--with yet another  Jewish joke.  It could be one of the  best-situated Jewish jokes in the world.<br>
  And the café is quite good.  (FOOD,  again, too.)<br>
  The café of the Whitechapel Gallery, in fact, overlooks the Freedom Press. <br>

<p>Stanley Kubrick:  better than a memorial:  the &lsquo;joke mirror&rsquo; </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>So Steven Spielberg has just  died and he's being greeted at the gate by Gabriel and</em></li>
  <li><em>Gabriel says:  'God's really dug a lot of your movies and he  wants to make sure that you're comfortable.   If there's anything you need, you come to me, I'm your man.' And Steven</em><em>says, 'Well, you know, I always  wanted to meet Stanley Kubrick, do you think you could arrange that?'  And Gabriel looks at him and says: 'You know,  Steven, of all the things that you could ask for, why would you ask for that?  You know that Stanley doesn't take</em><em>meetings.' He says, 'Well, you  said that if there was anything I wanted.' Gabriel says: 'I&rsquo;m</em><em>really sorry. I can't do that.'  So now he's showing him around heaven and Steven sees this</em><em>guy wearing an army jacket with  a beard riding a bicycle. And Steven says to Gabriel: 'Oh, my God, look, over  there, that's Stanley Kubrick. Couldn't we just stop him and say hello?' </em></li>
  <li><em>And Gabriel pulls Steven to the  side and says, 'That's not Stanley Kubrick; that's God – he</em><em>just thinks he's Stanley  Kubrick.'</em></li>
</ul>

<em>Image:  This is in the Whitechapel Gallery. It&rsquo;s not that easy to find the café. But  keep trying.</em></p>
<p><strong>Stanley  Kubrick-iana</strong><br>
  For those interested in the great director, see  the joke in the Whitechapel Art Gallery. <br>
  There&rsquo;s also a tremendous archive of his working  material at the University of the Arts in Elephant and Castle. <br>
  Yarnton Manor, near Oxford, which used to be the  home of the Oxford Centre for Hebrew &amp; Jewish Studies, was used to film one  of Kubrick&rsquo;s least successful films, <em>Barry Lyndon.</em></p>

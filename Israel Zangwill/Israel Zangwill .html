<h1 align="center"><strong>Israel Zangwill</strong></h1>
<p align="center"><br>
  From York Hall you can take a longish walk down  the Old Ford Road.  Again, it&rsquo;s worth the  trek all the way down to Victoria Park.   The point here is to recall and reflect on one of the most famous  figures in all of Anglo-Jewish history, Israel Zangwill.  Zangwill moved to this part of the East End  after he had become pretty successful.   It&rsquo;s not dank and crowded.  Bryan  Cheyette is writing a new biography of Zangwill.<br>

  Near Mendoza&rsquo;s home and York Hall is one of the  former residences of Israel Zangwill, on Old Ford Road.  Zangwill is remembered as a great and  important writer, but I fear that most of his work in nearly unreadable  now.  He was, however, a far more  important political figure than most people assume.  He helped Zionism get a foothold in Britain,  and was an unusually popular figure among Jews worldwide. <br>
  After the British government offered the Zionist movement a change for  settlement in East Africa (called &lsquo;Uganda&rsquo;), which was not pursued, he was a  leader of the &lsquo;Territorial&rsquo; or &rsquo;Territorialist&rsquo; movement which has been much  derided.  It was probably one of the more  serious such efforts of all time.<br>
  In the coming year (2015-16) UCL will be  acquiring a small but superb collection of Zangwill publications and other  material, donated by Tony Yablon.  <img src="Israel Zangwill 2.jpg" width="555" height="800" alt=""/><br>

  Again, the house (of Israel Zangwill).  It was, and to this day, is considered quite  a good location—because it is situated across from Victoria Park.<br>

<p align="center"><br>
  The lion&rsquo;s share of Jewish workers in the East  End, from around the period of the mass immigration to the 1940s, were in the  &lsquo;needle trades,&rsquo; that is, they worked in the garment industry.  This memorial is to recognize the former  important of the &lsquo;garment trade&rsquo; to the East End.  It&rsquo;s located just east of the Shoreditch High  Street station.  It&rsquo;s interesting but not  easily recognizable as symbolizing the needle trades.<br>

  &ldquo;This sculpture by artists Tim and Hattie  Coppard was erected in 1996 as part of the Bethnal Green city challenge  regeneration programme, and marks one of the entrances to Brick Lane  market.  The threads are a reminder of  the importance of the garment and textile industries in this part of London and  of the many communities who have lived and worked in the area.&rdquo;<br>

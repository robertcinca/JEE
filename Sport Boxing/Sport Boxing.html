<h1 align="center"><strong>Sport: Boxing</strong></h1>
<p align="center"><br>
  Boxing was arguably the biggest  sport in the East End.  Jewish boxers,  beginning in the late eighteenth century, were major figures behind the scenes  and in the ring.  <br>
  Isaac Bitton, the fighter pictured  here, is, in fact, an ancestor of the actress June Brown of <em>East Enders</em> fame.  This was taken for the the BBC  show, <em>Who Do You Think You Are</em>. <br>

  Isaac Bitton  (1779-1839) was regarded as one of the great fighters and colorful personalities  of his age.  A contemporary of Daniel  Mendoza, the number of rounds he fought was astounding even in a time when a  boxing match could go on for an entire evening or afternoon.  Subject to repeated anti-Semitic abuse, it  did not seem to injure his self-confidence and good humor.  Although he carried substantial heft even in  his prime, he was famed for being light on his feet, always giving a  tremendous—even dazzling--show in the ring.   He died, though, grossly overweight.   Isaac's descendant, the talented and elegant June Brown, is best known  as Dot Cotton in the long-running television show, East  Enders.<br>
  Born in Suffolk (1927), June Brown MBE was one  of five children, two of whom did not survive into adulthood.  During the Second World War she was evacuated  to a Welsh village, and then served in the Wrens (Royal Navy).  June trained at The Bristol Old Vic Theatre  School.  While on the one hand she was  typically &ldquo;English&rdquo;, June became aware that her forebears had come from  Ireland, Scotland, Italy, and perhaps elsewhere—and that some were Jews.  On her maternal grandmother&rsquo;s side of the  family was the famous boxer Isaac Bitton (spelled variously as Bitoon, Piton,  etc.)  The family had originated in Oran,  Algeria.  London&rsquo;s East End, though, is  crucial in the story of both June and Isaac.  <br>

<p><strong>The  Krays!</strong><br>
  178 Vallance Road, E2. <br>
  Here&rsquo;s where infamous London  criminals the Kray brothers lived (with their mum, of course), such nice boys  they were.  The official Jewish community  won&rsquo;t claim them as Jewish but they themselves had no doubt that part of their  mongrel heredity was &lsquo;Jewish&rsquo;.  <br>

  More Kray-mania:   The Blind Beggar pub, on the corner of Whitechapel Road and Cambridge  Heath Road, E1 1BU.  It is alleged that  Ronnie Kray (some say Reggie, some say Charlie) killed their rival, George  Cornell, at the bar in March 1966. <br>

  The Krays were great admirers of the great  Jewish boxers such as Ted &ldquo;Kid&rdquo; Lewis and Jack &ldquo;Kid&rdquo; Berg.  They, like almost everyone in the East End,  were aware of the long-standing tradition of Jewish fighters in the East End. The  most famous of them all was Daniel Mendoza (1764-1836). Below is Clive  Betttington, who&rsquo;s done more than anyone to honor and respect the tradition of  Mendoza and the other fighters.  <br>

  The sculpture held by Clive Bettington is based  on the work <em>Mendoza</em> of Jean Charles Robineau, mezzotint by Henry  Kingsbury.  Published by Pores,  1789.  [Courtesy of The Jewish Museum  London.]  Daniel Mendoza (1765-1836),  born in Aldgate, started fighting in the streets of London's East End and  gained his reputation after beating Harry the Coalheaver in 1784.  He received the patronage of the Prince of  Wales, who arranged a bout against Martin the Bath Butcher in 1787.  Mendoza's victory over Martin paved the way  for his contests against Humphries, which were hailed by many Jews as showing  the superiority, overall, of Jews versus gentiles.  This Robineau image was published one day  before the second of his three fights with Humphries. Mendoza himself saw the  need to make pugilism more regulated respectable—which also would give Jews a  legal and rationalized means of fighting back.   Despite his success in the ring and great acclaim, Mendoza struggled  with indebtedness and was in and out of jail.   There are, however, many people who are immensely proud to claim him as  their ancestor, including the actor Peter Sellers (1925-1980), who as Inspector  Clouseau had a print of Mendoza hanging in his office. <br>
  There are a few sites in the East End tied to  Bitton&rsquo;s contemporary, Daniel Mendoza.   It&rsquo;s at 3 Paradise Row, just north of the Bethnal Green Road. <br>

  Mendoza, like Bitton, also was a &lsquo;publican&rsquo; but  he did not make a decent living from it. Both he and Bitton died  destitute.  This is probably one of his  nicer residences.  <br>
  It&rsquo;s worth making the trek up Bethnal Green Road  to see this and other sights. If you wish to start here, just get out at  Bethnal Green tube station (Central Line.)   Mendoza&rsquo;s house is just seconds out of the tube. <br>

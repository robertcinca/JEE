  LSE:   Funny, isn&rsquo;t it, London Stock Exchange (the essence of capitalism) and  the London School of Economics, formerly seen as red or pink in its politics,  are both &ldquo;LSE&rdquo;.  The university, though,  is usually called &ldquo;THE LSE.&rdquo;  Now isn&rsquo;t  that special.<br>
  <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/home.aspx">http://www.lse.ac.uk/home.aspx</a><br>
  LSE has been home to a number of notable Jewish  scholars, not the least of whom is the father of the current leader of the  Labour Party, Ralph Miliband. <br>
  Ed Miliband himself lives in Dartmouth Park, but  I won&rsquo;t say exactly where.  (Don&rsquo;t bother  him, he&rsquo;s busy.) <br>

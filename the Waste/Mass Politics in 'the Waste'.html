<h1 align="center"><strong>Mass Politics in &lsquo;the Waste&rsquo;</strong></h1>
<p align="center"><br>
  Jewish &lsquo;mass politics&rsquo; around the  turn of the century (west of Cambridge Heath Road north of Mile End Road) <br>
  This postcard has Theodor Herzl  (1860-1904) in the centre.  Herzl was a  founder of the modern Zionist movement—the attempt to establish a home for the  Jewish people in their ancestral land of Palestine.  <br>
  Moses Gaster (1856-1939) is in the  top left corner.  In 1896, Gaster, head  of the British <em>Sephardic</em> Jewish community (but not one himself, go  figure) arranged one of the most crucial mass-meetings for Herzl in &lsquo;the  waste&rsquo;—a large vacant area on the Whitechapel High Street.   Herzl did not really speak Yiddish or  English, but the Jewish crowd was enthralled by his presentation. <br>
  Gaster is one of the most brilliant  figures in the history of Anglo-Jewry yet has received shocking little  recognition from scholars, or even the general public. <br>

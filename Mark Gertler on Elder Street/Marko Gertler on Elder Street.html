<p align="center"><br>
  North of Spitalifields Market, which is pretty  upscale these days, go to Elder Street.   This is the home of one my favorite Anglo-Jewish artists, Mark Gertler.</p>

<p>This is the home of the artist Mark Gertler  (1891-1939).  It&rsquo;s worth a fortune now,  but when he lived there it probably was not considered a very desirable place  to live.   (Don&rsquo;t miss the coal shute.)<br>

<p>This is the coal shute (hole) in front of Mark  Gertler&rsquo;s house.<br>
  The image is from his work, &lsquo;Carousel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Gertler was a student at University College  London&rsquo;s Slade School of Art, one of the world&rsquo;s leading art schools.  This is probably, more-or-less, what he  looked like then.</p>

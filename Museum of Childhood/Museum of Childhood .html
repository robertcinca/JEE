<p align="center"><br>
  Museum Gardens is just south of the V&amp;A  Museum of Childhood (formerly the Bethnal Green Museum of Childhood).  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/moc/">http://www.vam.ac.uk/moc/</a></p>
<p>The museum is now part of the Victoria &amp;  Albert, one of the world&rsquo;s greatest collections of applied arts and  crafts.   Why mention it here?<br>

  <em>Image: Jews and toys!</em><br>
  Some of the toys that became seen as  quintessentially British were created or developed by Jewish immigrants.  The &lsquo;Matchbox&rsquo; brand of toy cars derived from  the &ldquo;Mekko&rdquo; company, whose principal figure was Moses Kohnstam. You&rsquo;ll find  these at the Bethnal Green Museum of Childhood.<br>

  Again, from the Bethnal Green Museum of  Childhood:  My favorites are &ldquo;Corgi&rdquo; cars  (nothing to do with the dogs so beloved by the royal family.)  There are several toys in the museum from  Tipp &amp; Co., which was founded by the Ullman family in Germany.  They were forced to sell their company at a  much distressed price in Nazi times.   Members of the family, though, made their way to England and established  the &ldquo;Mettoy.&rdquo;  Corporation.  This is the company that produced &ldquo;Corgi.&rdquo;<br>

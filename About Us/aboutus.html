  <em>Discover the Jewish East End!</em></p>
<p><em>Beginning with the Jewish East End:&nbsp;&nbsp;Not  quite kosher</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Explore London's Jewish East End—emphasizing serious history,  strong opinions, and humour </li>
  <li>Specific sites illustrated through photographs, text, and location  maps </li>
  <li>Take a tour—or just learn about somewhere you&rsquo;ve happened  onto.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Get a recommendation for what and where to eat—and learn something  in the process! </li>
  <li>Featuring history, food, religion &amp; politics, sport, and  various entertainments </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Your host for this excursion is Michael Berkowitz,  Professor of Modern Jewish History in the Department of Hebrew &amp; Jewish  Studies, University College London (UCL).</em> <br>
  <em>The opinions (and tastes) expressed here, are  entirely his own (except if stolen.)</em></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Berkowitz studied in London in 1979 and returned regularly to  visit his cousin, the late Elena&nbsp;Berkaite, who sought refuge Britain  during the Second World War.&nbsp;&nbsp;This presentation is dedicated to  Elena—a self-described &lsquo;culture-vulture.&rsquo;</em></li>
  <li><em>Berkowitz has lived full-time in London since 1997, when appointed  Reader (Associate Professor) in Jewish history at UCL.</em></li>
  <li><em>He has written extensively on a number of subjects including the  history of the Zionist movement, Jewish political representations, boxing,  crime, and photography.&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>CAVEAT EMPTOR</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>This app is not comprehensive.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>There are major, well-known sites of Jewish interest that have not  been included. </li>
  <li>Many of them are, indeed, worth a visit.&nbsp; </li>
  <li><em>Gib&nbsp;a&nbsp;kuk</em>,*&nbsp;as we say in Bloomsbury. </li>
  <li><em>*take&nbsp;a look; give it a quick look, at least</em></li>

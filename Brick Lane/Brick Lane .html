  The heart of it all:  Brick Lane:   Food AND Religion AND business (meets history).<br>
  <em>In answer to the eternal  question:  &quot;where are the best  bagels in London (even the world)?&rdquo;     </em>Beigel Bake <br>
  <img src="Image 1.jpg" width="2203" height="1652" alt=""/><br>
  One of the most important things to know about &ldquo;Beigel  Bake&rdquo; is that it&rsquo;s not the &ldquo;Beigel Shop&rdquo; which claims to be &ldquo;Britain&rsquo;s first  and best.&rdquo;<br>
  <strong>OK, try it for yourself!</strong> <br>

  Not only is <em>Beigel Bake </em>great  for bagels, it&rsquo;s also one of the best places to get a hot salt beef  sandwich.  Hot salt beef is not the same  as &lsquo;corned beef&rsquo; in the United States.   It&rsquo;s more like a boiled brisket. When it&rsquo;s good it&rsquo;s fabulous. When it&rsquo;s  lousy—you shouldn&rsquo;t know from it.<br>

  Gherkins, on a hot salt beef sandwich. Get it on  rye with mustard.  </p>
<p>Beigel Bake is, in fact, one of the best  illustrations imaginable of one of the oldest Jewish jokes in the world.<br>
  <br>
  <em>A Jewish guy is shipwrecked and stranded for years on a desert island.  <br>
    When he's finally rescued he shows  the sailors the camp he's made.  <br>
    &lsquo;That's where I sleep,&rsquo; he  says.  &lsquo;That's where I cook and  eat.&rsquo;  <br>
  &lsquo;And those are the two synagogues.&rsquo;  <br>
    Why?   Every Jew knows, of course.  <br>
    You have to have the </em>shul(synagogue) <em>you go to—and the one you'd never step foot in. <br>
      <br>
</em>In the East End, to this day, there's the bagel shop you go to—and the one  you don't go to.  It's still a good joke,  which especially befits this particular island. </p>
<p>What is this with the nutty spelling of  &ldquo;bagel&rdquo;?  Why &ldquo;beigel&rdquo;?  &ldquo;Baigel&rdquo;?   &ldquo;Baigle&rdquo;?  &ldquo;Beigle&rdquo;?<br>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Former Blooms Restaurant in the East End</strong><br>
  People sometimes speak fondly of the former <em>Blooms</em> restaurant in the East End.  <br>
  They&rsquo;re nuts.<br>
  It wasn&rsquo;t very good and a ripoff.  OK, it  was terrible.<br>
  When I went with my friend Lois in 1979, the waiter kept saying &lsquo;would you like  this?&rsquo;, &lsquo;would you like that?&rsquo;—we had no idea we were being charged for  everything.  The one in Golders Green  also sucked.  (Yes, that&rsquo;s my  professional, academic opinion.)  One of  the best restaurant reviews of all time is Jay Rayner&rsquo;s diatribe from 2007:  <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/jul/01/foodanddrink.shopping1">http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/jul/01/foodanddrink.shopping1</a> <br>
  That isn&rsquo;t to say, though, there isn&rsquo;t good Jewish food to be had in  London.  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Should you be away from the  East End, you can also find some worthwhile fressing (eating) on Oxford  Street:  Selfridges. </li>
  <li>Yes, Selfridges.  Most of the UK&rsquo;s famous department stores,  with the great exception of M&amp;S, were not Jewish-founded or Jewish oriented  in any way.  Selfridge&rsquo;s is now known for <em>&ldquo;Mr Selfridge&rdquo;</em> played by the über-Jewish Jeremy Piven, but that doesn&rsquo;t  quite make Selfridge&rsquo;s Jewish.  But they  do have a very good salt beef bar, called the Brass Rail.  It&rsquo;s slightly pricier than the others but the  quality is consistently superb. </li>
  <li>In the old days people used to  joke about the poor quality and availability of coffee in the UK.  That was never really the case, and even less  true now.  On Brick Lane there are a  number of excellent places for coffee.   My favorite is &ldquo;Full Stop.&rdquo;<br>
    Hey, I&rsquo;ll give you a link to facebook (even though I&rsquo;m not a member.)  <br>

  <li>My late colleague Bob Liberles  wrote a great book about Jews and coffee:<br>

full stop. This a great place.  Room to sit and relax.  WiFi. </p>
<p><strong>Gourmet  Chocolate Shop</strong><br>
  A relatively new addition to the rich offerings  of Brick Lane is this gourmet chocolate shop.   It&rsquo;s hard to miss at the southwestern corner of Brick Lane and Bacon  Street.  The fare is good and interesting  but a bit pricey (as to be expected.) <br>

Jews are ever fearful of diabetes as a dreaded  &lsquo;Jewish&rsquo; disease but they love chocolate, as a rule. Sander Gilman, one of the  most prolific and interesting scholars of all time, has &lsquo;podcasted&rsquo; as well as  written on the subject. </p>
<p><strong>Amy  Winehouse</strong><br>
  Amy Winehouse (z''l) didn&rsquo;t live in the East  End, and identified mainly with Camden Town.   But her image is plastered all over the East End.   An exhibition devoted to Amy was staged at  the Jewish Museum London in 2013:<br>
  http://www.jewishmuseum.org.uk/Amy<br>
  <br>
  Is it Jewish?  Just hipster?  A little of both, possibly.   You need to visit Brick Lane during  off-hours to see these.<br>
  <img src="Image 7.jpg" width="3264" height="2448" alt=""/><br>
  How many Amy Winehouse images are there in the  East End?  Who knows. This one is on the  intersection with Bacon Street. <br>

<p><strong>Chaim  N. Katz</strong><br>
  Chaim N. Katz:   he specialized, all he sold was string! (supposedly).  There used to be loads of signs like these in  Brick Lane.  Now it&rsquo;s an art gallery.  This one of the featured part's of Clive's  tour. <br>

<p align="center"><br>
  Bloomsbury, though not often thought of for its  Jewish dimensions, has a number of extremely significant sites of Jewish  interest, not the least of which is University College London.  &ldquo;The Godless College in Gower Street,&rdquo; it was  the first university in the UK to claim a secular perspective and admit Jews,  Catholics, dissidents, and non-believers altogether.<br>

  Even prior to the emergence of &lsquo;Jewish Studies&rsquo;  in the United States and Europe, the field was pioneered at UCL by Hyman  Hurwitz. <br>
  UCL was the first university in the world to  encourage Jews and Judaism to be explored on their own terms, as opposed to  subservient to Christianity (as at Oxbridge), especially by becoming the  institutional home of the Jewish Historical Society of England.  <br>
  Despite being the &ldquo;Godless College&rdquo; there is one  piece of quasi-religious material culture apparent in the Gustav Tuck  Theatre:  the motto of the Jewish  Historical Society of England, in Hebrew <br>

  Modern economics, that is, economics treated in  an intellectualized, detached, abstract manner could was pioneered by David  Ricardo and those inspired by him at UCL. <br>

  Ricardo didn&rsquo;t remain a Jew after  adulthood.  He became a Unitarian, but  heck, we all know what they are.  (Great  religion, really.)  But his criticism of  Malthus, and the way that he asked questions regarding &lsquo;political economy&rsquo; changed  economics forever. <br>

<p>The most obvious material manifestations of the  &lsquo;Jewish&rsquo; origins of UCL<br>
  can be found in and around the Gustave Tuck Theatre.<br>
  Here&rsquo;s Gustave!  Great jowls, huh? <br>

  Despite the arch-anti-religiousness of UCL (a very good thing), a little bit of  quasi-religion creeps in:  the motto  above the chalkboard/screen in the Gustave Tuck Theatre:<br>
  &ldquo;Remember the days of old consider the years of each generation.&rdquo;<br>
  Now what the heck does that mean?  Guess  it has something to do with history. <br>

  One of the reminders of the war, while also  recalling the fact that UCL was indeed the home of the Jewish Historical  Society of England, and once held one of the country&rsquo;s first Jewish museums. <br>

  <strong>Chinese  food</strong></h1>
<p align="center"><br>
  If you&rsquo;re looking for a good Chinese restaurant in the East End, try  Sichuan-Folk.  There&rsquo;s a much greater  range of dishes than your average Chinese restaurant, and they dare to spice  things up.  It&rsquo;s on Hanbury Street, E1  6QR, just off of Brick Lane.  Try the  frog&rsquo;s legs.<br>
  (<em>Glatt trayf</em>.*)  Make sure to spit  out the bones.<br>
*glatt trayf—not just  unkosher—<em>really, really unkosher</em></p>

<p><strong>Hanbury  Street:  Home of Bud Flanagan  (1896-1968):  </strong>nice  Jewish boy?<br>
  Born Chaim Reuben Weintrop (possibly a  corruption of &quot;Weintraub&quot;), he took the name from his drill sergeant  he didn&rsquo;t particularly care for. <br>
  As a soldier in World War I he was gassed (and  temporarily blinded) at Vandelle Wood. <br>
  He didn&rsquo;t turn out like that more famous guy who  got wounded, gassed, and temporarily blinded—a certain Adolf Hitler.  But he managed to make fun of Hitler in the  film &ldquo;Gasbags&rdquo; (1939). <br>
  His father ran a barber shop and sold tobacco  products. <br>
  &ldquo;Bud&rdquo; had varied and fabulous career on stage  (of almost all types) and screen, leader of the &quot;Crazy Gang&quot;—a team  three duos and one hanger-on. <br>
  He remained a pretty jewy-Jew, even in his  various roles as a performer, thoughout his career. <br>
  He was seriously talented and an excellent  singer.<br>
Many of the Crazy Gang movies are available on  youtube.  The most fascinating of them is  &quot;Gasbags&quot; (1941), but others are worth viewing, such as &quot;A Fire  Has Been Arranged&quot; (1935).</p>
